## Hey, I'm Anish ðŸ‘‹

BTech CS @ PES Â· Exploring system architecture, AI and web development

Curious about what runs under the hood, from OSes and compilers to LLMs and internet protocols. I mostly code in C and Rust, but also use Python, Go, and JS when speed matters.

Currently focused on building projects around secure communication, self-sovereign identity, and practical uses of AI beyond chat that actually solves real problems.
