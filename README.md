## Hey, I'm Anish (aka an1) ðŸ‘‹

BTech CS @ PES | Computer Science undergrad exploring the intersection of AI, systems, and the web.

I'm interested in how things work under the hood â€” from operating systems and compilers to LLMs and protocols. I enjoy working with lower-level languages like C and Rust, but also build with Python, JavaScript, and Go when it makes sense.

Currently focused on secure communication, self-sovereign identity, and practical uses of AI beyond chat.
