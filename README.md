BTech CS @ PES Â· Exploring system architecture, AI and the web

Curious about what runs under the hood, from OSes and compilers to LLMs and internet protocols. Mostly code in C and Rust, but I use Python, Go, and JS when speed matters.

Currently focused on building projects around secure communication, self-sovereign identity, and practical uses of AI beyond chat that actually solves real problems.
